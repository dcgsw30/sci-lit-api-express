# Sci-Lit Citation Application

Welcome to my first personal project, Sci-Lit! Before switching into the field of Computer Science, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Biology where I did lots of research projects and papers. While working on my undergraduate thesis, I realized how difficult it was to manage all my citations and use different citation plugins such as Zotero. I created this application to support myself and other life-science academics sort different scientific literature and keep track of reading progress for each paper! 

In this project, I used languages such as HTML and CSS to design the websites, Javascript to enable user interactions, and Express for the back end.
